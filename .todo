- Anonymous users
  - A group should be able to contain "anonymous" users, that is users that isn't tied to a login.
  - When creating a new score you should be able to create a new "anonymous" user and score for said user.
  - The anonymous user should be able to be "claimed" by a real user when they join a group.
    - Claiming a anonymous user should transfer all scores from the anonymous user to the user who claimed it.
